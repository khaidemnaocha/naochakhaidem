	<center><p>The study of trigonometric was first started in India.<br/>The ancient Indian Mathematicians.Aryabatta(476A.D.),Brahmagupta (598 A.D.),Bhaskar I<br/> (600 A.D.) and Bhaskara II (1114 A.D.) got important results of trigonometry.All this knowledge went from India to Arabia and then from there to Europe.The<br/> Greeks had also started the study of trigonometry but their approach was so <br/> clumsy that when the Indian approach become known,it was immediately adopted<br/> throughout the world.</p>
		<p>In Indian, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functuions,known as <br/>the sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents one of <br/> the main contribution of the <i>siddhantas</i>(Sanskrit astronomical works ) to mathematics.<br/></p> 
		<p> Bhaskara I(about 600A.D.) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions<br/> for angles more than 90<sup>0</sup></sup>. A sixteen century Malayalam work <i>Yuktibhasa</i> <br/>contains a proof for the expanssion of sin(A+B).Exact expression for the sines or <br/>coines of 18<sup>o</sup>,54<sup>0</sup>,72<sup>0</sup>,etc., were given by Bhaskara II<br/>.</p>The symbols sin<sup>-1</sup>x,cos<sup>-1</sup>x,etc.,for arc cosx, etc.,suggested<br/> by the astronomer Sir john F.W Hersehel (1813) The name of Thales <br/>(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems.He <br/> is created with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in egypt by <br/>measuring shadows of the pyrmid and an auxiliary staaf (or gnomon)of knowns <br/> height ,and comparing the ratios:</p> </center>

		<center><p>Thales is also said to have calulated the distance  of a ship at sea through <br/> the proporionaliity of sides of similar triangles.Problems on height and distnce usiing the simiilarity prorerty are also found in anciant Indian works.</p></center>
